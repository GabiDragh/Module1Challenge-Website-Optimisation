# Module 1 Challenge Website Optimisation

Horiseon website existing code files refactored to increase the application visibility in search engines and made more accessible for people with disabilities such as the visually impaired. Index.html sections have been given semantic meaning by adding corresponding tags, and all images and graphics have received a description. Style.css file modified to reflect the changes in index.html and restructured to follow the html sequential order, while certain elements have been consolidated. 

## Steps taken

1. Git repository named Module1Challenge-Website-Optimisation created 
2. Current README.md file created.
3. Index.html file amended for the body of the code to clearly show head, body and footer sections. Footer not visible in the assignment demo screenshot, therefore the visibility is set to none in style.css file.
4. The generic container DIV used in the initial file has been replaced with semantic elements such as NAV for the navigation bar unordered list contents, the SECTION tag has been applied to separate the main content information, followed by assigning the ASIDE tag to the side content. 
5. ALT attribute applied to all images, as it is needed if the browser does not display it or if the user cannot see it for any reason. The description gives context to the user to be able to imagine it and enough key words for it to have better chances to be found by a search engine.
6. Style.CSS restructured, the properties that were not in order have been shifted around to follow the logical sequence of the html. Elements having the same properties have been grouped together by using the semantic tags and not individually by id or class. 
7. All changes in both files index.html and style.css are commented.
8. All data commented and push in the Git repository.
